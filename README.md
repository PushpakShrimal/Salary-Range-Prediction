## üéØ Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether an individual's annual income is greater than $50,000 based on demographic and employment data from census records. This is a binary classification task that demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and comparative evaluation. Such a model has real-world applications in socio-economic analysis, financial services, and targeted marketing campaigns.

## üìä The Dataset

The analysis is performed on the `salary.csv` dataset, which contains **32,561 entries** and **15 features**, including:
-   **Demographics:** `age`, `sex`, `race`, `marital-status`
-   **Education:** `education`, `education-num`
-   **Employment:** `workclass`, `occupation`, `hours-per-week`
-   **Target Variable:** `salary` (<=50K or >50K)

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Workflow

The project followed a structured approach to build and evaluate the classification models:

1.  **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was loaded and inspected for missing values. Null entries in the `workclass`, `occupation`, and `native-country` columns were imputed using the mode (most frequent value).

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of various features. The target variable `salary` was found to be imbalanced, with about **76%** of individuals earning **<=50K** and **24%** earning **>50K**.

3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    -   **Label Encoding:** All categorical features were converted into a numerical format using Label Encoding, making them suitable for machine learning models.
    -   **Feature Scaling:** All features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure that no single feature disproportionately influences the model's predictions.

4.  **Model Training & Comparison:** The preprocessed data was split into training and testing sets. Four different classification models were trained and evaluated:
    -   Logistic Regression
    -   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    -   Random Forest Classifier
    -   **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using TensorFlow/Keras

## üèÜ Results & Model Performance

The models were evaluated based on their accuracy on the test set. The **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and **Random Forest** models delivered the best performance, with the ANN achieving a top accuracy of **84.65%**.

Here is a comparison of the accuracy scores for each model:

| Model                     | Accuracy on Test Set |
| ------------------------- | :------------------: |
| **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** |      **84.65%** |
| Random Forest             |        84.46%        |
| Logistic Regression       |        81.28%        |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) |        80.99%        |
